Car Recommendation System with Python and Tkinter
Overview
This project implements an AI-based car recommendation system using Python and Tkinter. The system assists users in finding the most suitable car based on their preferences and requirements through a user-friendly graphical interface built with Tkinter.

Features
User-Friendly Interface: The system provides a simple and intuitive graphical interface using Tkinter, allowing users to input their preferences easily.
Machine Learning Model: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze user input and recommend cars that best match the criteria.
Car Database Integration: Integrates a database of cars with detailed specifications and features to provide accurate recommendations.
Recommendation Engine: Employs a recommendation engine to suggest the top cars based on the user's preferences.
Customization Options: Users can customize their search criteria such as budget, desired features, fuel efficiency, etc.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for developing the recommendation system and backend logic.
Tkinter: Python's standard GUI toolkit used for building the graphical user interface.
Pandas: Data manipulation library used for handling the car dataset.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library used for building and training the recommendation model.
