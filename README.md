# Car Recommendation System with Python and Tkinter

## Overview
This project implements an AI-based car recommendation system using Python and Tkinter. The system assists users in finding the most suitable car based on their preferences and requirements through a user-friendly graphical interface built with Tkinter.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The system provides a simple and intuitive graphical interface using Tkinter, allowing users to input their preferences easily.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze user input and recommend cars that best match the criteria.
- **Car Database Integration:** Integrates a database of cars with detailed specifications and features to provide accurate recommendations.
- **Recommendation Engine:** Employs a recommendation engine to suggest the top cars based on the user's preferences.
- **Customization Options:** Users can customize their search criteria such as budget, desired features, fuel efficiency, etc.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Programming language used for developing the recommendation system and backend logic.
- **Tkinter:** Python's standard GUI toolkit used for building the graphical user interface.
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation library used for handling the car dataset.
- **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning library used for building and training the recommendation model.
